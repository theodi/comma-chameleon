##Development setup

you can use npm to install all relevant packages using the following set of commands
```
brew install node
npm install
cd app/
bower install
```


Then to open the app run:

```
cd .. # begin from root directory
npm start
# it is also possible to run electron app/ to begin the electron app
```

## Testing

two npm scripts have been specified to run the electron-mocha tests. At time of development the repository has not developed
an integrated way of testing Electron's respective `renderer` and `main` procesess and requires different args and paths to
execute.
The tests can be invoked by
`npm run mocha-main`
`npm run mocha-renderer`
below are the args and paths. However it is not possible to run these commands unless you install electron-mocha globally

```
electron-mocha app/test/main/ # run tests for the runtime components provided by Electron
electron-mocha --renderer app/test/renderer/ # run tests that execute client side
```

[Electron-Mocha](https://github.com/jprichardson/electron-mocha) has been adopted for testing, it enables both DOM and node.js testing and provides command line options to
enable testing of both
Testing DOM with electon-mocha follows the same invocation and declaration patterns as [jsdom()](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha-jsdom) but provides genuine DOM access

Javascript is followed the `module.exports` pattern for module interface
Tests have adopted a provisional pattern of using underscore `_` to denote private methods and making them available to
 the unit test environment through the following addition to the `module.exports` pattern
 ```
 module.exports = {
   // public interface
 };
 if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test') {
   module.exports._private = {
    // private methods made available for unit tests
   }
 }

Tests set a local NODE_ENV paramter when executing

##running the tests
to run tests for the main (i.e. runtime) javascript:
    electron-mocha app/test/main/

to run tests for the renderer (i.e. client facing/side) javascript:
    electron-mocha --renderer app/test/renderer/

## Building a new package

(This assumes you're running OSX)

```
brew install wine # This allows us to specify the icon for Windows pacakges
npm i electron-packager -g
script/build
```
